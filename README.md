Chintz PHP Demo
===============

Using the [PHP parser](https://github.com/BBC-News/chintz-php) for the [Chintz demo library](https://github.com/BBC-News/chintz#what-is-chintz).

## Getting started with the demo

 - Clone this repo to somewhere a web server can see it
 - [Get Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if you haven't already
 - Run composer install
 - Visit `index.php` in the browser

You have now installed the demo Chintz library. It should look a bit like [this hosted version](http://peterchamberlin.com/experiments/chintz-parser-php-demo/index.php).
